IPython: An Interactive Computing Environment
=============================================

The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
interactive and exploratory computing.  To support, this goal, IPython
has two main components:

	- An enhanced interactive Python shell.
	- An architecture for interactive parallel computing.

All of IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license), and it is
used by a range of `other projects <http://wiki.ipython.org/Projects_using_IPython>`_.
Have a look at the `talks and presentations <presentation.html>`_ we have given
about IPython.  

IPython supports Python 2.6 to 2.7 officially.  Our 0.10 series supports Python
2.5, and probably works well with 2.4, though we haven't tested it extensively
with that version.

Announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **IPython 0.11**: We're pleased to announce the immediate release of IPython
  0.11, a major new version and the result of over two years of changes.
  `Download <download.html>`_ it now, or look at `what's new
  <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/whatsnew/version0.11.html>`_.  At the
  recent SciPy 2011 conference we gave a talk about this version, you can
  `download the slides`_ or `watch the talk`_; afterwards Chris Fonnesbeck
  wrote an excellent post with a `visual tour of the new features`_.

- **User survey:** We'd like to know a bit about who uses IPython. Please
  `fill in <https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDMzREtNSk9pX282N3lxaXhiTmxyN0E6MQ>`_
  a short, anonymous survey. The `results <https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqIElKUDQl8tdDMzREtNSk9pX282N3lxaXhiTmxyN0E&hl=en_GB&authkey=CNOmu-QC#gid=0>`_
  are publically visible and automatically updated.

Citing IPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific
research, so it is important to us to be able to show the impact of our work in
other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication,
please acknowledge this fact by citing the project. You can use this
`ready-made citation entry <citing.html>`_.

Hosting
~~~~~~~
IPython has been generously hosted by `Enthought <http://enthought.com/>`_ almost since its inception.  We also use `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_ and `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for code hosting and distributed version control.
