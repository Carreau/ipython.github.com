**PyReadline**
==============

PyReadline is a Python module providing a readline API on Windows, using ctypes.

IPython previously used PyReadline to run on Windows, but moved away from it for
IPython 5.0. PyReadline is not actively developed at the moment (early 2017),
but you can still find it `on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyreadline>`_
and `on GitHub <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline>`_.
