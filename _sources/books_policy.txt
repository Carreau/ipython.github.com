Books Policy
============

Our policy for listing books on the website is as follows. This will be
uniformly applied across publishers, so the project can maintain its
neutrality regarding IPython-related books (all language below would apply
in the future to Jupyter-oriented books).

1. Criteria for inclusion in the homepage

We will list books that are specifically and mostly about IPython itself,
rather than just mentioning IPython in a chapter or two (though see Note in
#2 below).

For example, the currently listed book by Cyrille Rossant amply qualifies,
but Wes McKinney's "Python for Data Analysis", while having an excellent
chapter devoted to IPython, would not get a link on the home page.

2. Our "Books" page:

We will create a main page listing in reverse chronological order the various
books that are mainly devoted to IPython. For each book, we simply list its
title, author and actual publisher page (or Amazon, whatever the author prefers
or publisher prefers), along with a cover image. No
editorializing/reviews/etc.

There may be a section at the bottom listing books that include some useful
material about IPython (more than just a sentence but less than say 1/2 the
book).  These would be listed for reference but would have no front-page
link (e.g. Wes' book).

Note: the core team reserves the right to *not* include, or remove a book in this
listing. If someone out there publishes a book that we deem to be
absolutely terrible, we reserve the right to simply not list it.

3. What we show on the homepage

We will have a single image for books, and that will be a randomly rotating
screenshot of all currently available books.  That image will be a link to that
book's entry in the "Books" page. The randomly rotating screenshot may show
recently published book more often.

On the Book page, the books will be ordered with most recent at the top.
