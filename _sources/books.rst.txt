Jupyter Notebook is a web-based environment that enables interactive computing
in notebook documents. It allows you to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. The Jupyter
Notebook system is extensively used in domains such as data cleaning and
transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning,
and much more.

This book starts with a detailed overview of the Jupyter Notebook system and
its installation in different environments. Next weâ€™ll help you will learn to
integrate Jupyter system with different programming languages such as R,
Python, JavaScript, and Julia and explore the various versions and packages
that are compatible with the Notebook system. Moving ahead, you master
interactive widgets, namespaces, and working with Jupyter in a multiuser mode.

Towards the end, you will use Jupyter with a big data set and will apply all
the functionalities learned throughout the book.
