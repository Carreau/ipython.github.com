All videos and screencasts
--------------------------

* Brian Granger has a number of screencasts on his `YouTube channel
  <http://www.youtube.com/user/ellisonbg>`_ about using IPython's parallel
  computing capabilities.  These include a number of examples and a guide to
  getting started with IPython and Windows HPC Server 2008. Two of `these

  <http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The+HPC+Show/Open-source-HPC-code-Episode-12-IPython-computes-150-million-digits-of-Pi-in-Parallel/>`__
  are also being hosted on Microsoft's channel 9.
* The `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com>`_ site contains instructional videos on a
  number of topics.  `This page <http://wiki.ipython.org/ShowMeDo>`_
  (from our own wiki) contains further information on ideas for new
  IPython-related videos.
* Jose Unpingco has created a set of screencasts on using the Vision/IPython
  combo for parallel computing. They are available both at the `Ohio
  Supercomputer Center's user site <https://www.osc.edu/cms/sip/node/17>`_ and
  at `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=XCsI4bsup>`__.
* Another series by Jose Unpingco makes up a tutorial on IPython with a focus
  on scientific computing, which also include a lot of useful tips on Windows
  setup and configuration. This series is also available both at the `OSC user
  site <https://www.osc.edu/cms/sip/>`_ and at `ShowMeDo
  <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=N49qyIFOh>`__.
* A new `5-part series <http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=CnluURUTV>`_ by
  Jeff Rush, approximately 1 hour long. Jeff uses a working IPython to show
  many features. Created 2007.
  "...but I have to say that I loved the videos. And honestly, I (re)learned a
  few tricks along the way!..." - Fernando Perez.
* A new `5-minute slideshow overview
  <http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=980000&amp;fromSeriesID=98>`_ by Jeff
  Rush entitled "Python and the Interactive Shell 'IPython'". Created 2007.
* A set `of 4 videos
  <http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=PythonIPythonSeries>`_ by Ian Ozsvald
  showing various aspects of IPython. Created 2006.
