New edition of the IPython minibook
-----------------------------------

On October 25 2015, Cyrille Rossant published the second edition of the IPython minibook:
`Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization 2nd Ed.
<https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-ipython-interactive-computing-and-data-visualization-sec>`_,
for which `Damian Avila <https://github.com/damianavila>`_ was a technical
reviewer. We thank Packt Publishing for donating a portion of the proceeds
from this book to support IPython's development.

IPython 4.0
-----------

IPython 4.0 was released on August 11, 2015. This release corresponds to the
separation of IPython (as of 3.x) into multiple components, most of which are
now under the Jupyter organisation. See `the Jupyter blog post
<https://blog.jupyter.org/2015/04/15/the-big-split/>`_ for further explanation.

IPython 4.0 contains only the codebase for the features of IPython terminal
itself. Extra shims and warnings have been added to ease the transition of
currently existing code from IPython 3.x to the various new packages
(`ipyparallel`, `notebook`, `ipywidget`, `nbconvert`,...)

IPython 3.0
-----------

IPython 3.0 was released on February 27, 2015. This release integrates support
for languages other than Python - available kernels are `listed on the wiki
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages>`_.

`Install <install.html>`__ it now, or see the
`release notes <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version3.html>`__
for more details.

The 3.x release series will be the last where IPython is released as one big
package. For 4.0, we will split up components into several packages. The parts
which work for any language will be called *Jupyter*, while the parts specific
to executing Python code will remain as *IPython*.

IPython 2.4
-----------

IPython 2.4 was released on January 30, 2015. It adds support for the new
notebook format coming in IPython 3.0, along with fixing bugs in the 2.x series,
including compatibility with PyQt5 and Pygments 2.0.

IPython 2.3
-----------

IPython 2.3 includes bugfixes for 2.x, most importantly a fix for maths
rendering in notebooks exported to HTML by nbconvert. It was released on October
1, 2014.

Release of the IPython Cookbook
-------------------------------

On September 25 2014, Cyrille Rossant published the
`IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook <books.html>`_,

case study>`__ is now available that provides some details on the collaboration
between IPython and the University of Colorado's Mechanical Engineering
Department.

Support for Windows HPC Server 2008
-----------------------------------

.. image:: logos/logo-hpc2008-header.png


Recently, we have added support for Windows HPC Server 2008 in ipcluster.  This
makes it easy to get started with IPython's parallel computing capabilities on
Windows. These features are now in trunk and will be in the upcoming 0.11
release.  Brian Granger has created a `whitepaper
<attachment:ipython_winhpc_whitepaper_v1.pdf>`__ and `two
<http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The+HPC+Show/Open-source-HPC-code-Episode-11-IPython-Grid-Engine-running-on-Windows-HPC-Server-2008/>`__
`videos
<http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/The+HPC+Show/Open-source-HPC-code-Episode-12-IPython-computes-150-million-digits-of-Pi-in-Parallel/>`__
about using IPython on Windows HPC Server 2008. Additional information about
these features can be found in our documentation `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/parallel/parallel_winhpc.html>`__.
Many thanks to Microsoft for funding this effort.

What will become IPython 0.11 is taking shape, big changes ahead
----------------------------------------------------------------

As of November 2009, we have major changes coming to IPython. The next release
will include a lot of architectural updates, all of which we know are necessary
to really make significant improvements to IPython, but that also include
inevitable backward compatibility breaks.  We would like to encourage you to
start looking at the `nightly documentation
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/whatsnew/development.html>`__ and
`source tarball
<http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing/ipython-dev-nightly.tgz>`__ (you can also
follow the trunk from `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/ipython/trunk>`__).

IPython 0.10 has been released
------------------------------

On August 4 2009, we've released version 0.10 of IPython.  The full release
notes can be found `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.10/html/changes.html#release-0-10>`__,
describing in detail all new features, bug fixes and API changes of this
release.

IPython 0.9.1 has been released
-------------------------------

Unfortunately, release 0.9 turned out to have compatibility issues with Python
2.4.  This quick bugfix release addresses this issue but adds no other
features.

IPython 0.9 is out!
-------------------

On September 14, 2008, the IPython team is proud to release version 0.9 final.
See `here <http://ipython.scipy.org/announcements/ann-ipython-0.9.txt>`__ for
the full announcement; a detailed description of the changes can be found `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.9/html/changes.html#release-0-9>`__.

IPython 0.9 betas are ready
---------------------------

At `the usual location <http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing>`__ you can now
find the beta release of the 0.9 upcoming release.  We'd greatly appreciate
your testing and feedback!

IPython1 is dead, long live IPython (Summer 2008)
-------------------------------------------------

For the past three years, IPython1 has existed as a separate codebase from
IPython.  IPython1 was being used to develop IPython's architecture for
parallel computing as well as test new ideas for IPython itself.  Because the
parallel computing stuff is relatively stable now, we have completely merged
IPython1 into IPython.  Thus starting with IPython version 0.9, the parallel
computing capabilities (as well as a lot more new stuff) of IPython1 will be
available in regular IPython.  From here on out, there is no IPython1, just
IPython.

IPython 0.8.4
-------------
IPython 0.8.4 was released.

IPython 0.8.3
-------------
IPython 0.8.3 was released. See `what's new <whatsnew083.html>`__.

IPython1 and the Scripps Institute's Vision
-------------------------------------------

`Jose Unpingco <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco>`__ made this really neat
`screencast <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco/Tutorial_11Dec.html>`__ showing how to
couple IPython1 with the `Vision <http://mgltools.scripps.edu>`__ environment.
Vision is an extremely impressive visual programming environment developed by
`Michel Sanner's <http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner>`__ team at the Scripps
Institute in La Jolla, CA.

IPython and Django
------------------

A `blog entry
<http://blog.petersheats.com/2008/01/09/autoloading-your-django-models/>`__ by
Peter Sheats describing how to use IPython as the interactive shell for Django.

A new article about IPython at IBM Developer Works (Dec 12, 2007)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Noah Gift wrote a great `article
<https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-netsnmpnipython>`__ at the IBM
Developer Works site, on using the Net-SNMP library to interactively explore
and manage a network (the interactive part courtesy of IPython, of course).

IPython 0.8.2 is released (Nov 30, 2007)
----------------------------------------

Version 0.8.2 is out. See `a summary of the changes <whatsnew082.html>`__ , or
read the gory details in the full `ChangeLog
<http://ipython.scipy.org/ChangeLog>`__.

First release of IpyKit (May 24, 2007)
--------------------------------------

`IpyKit <http://wiki.python.org/moin/IPyKit>`__ is a standalone IPython executable,
created with py2exe and as such works on machines without python (or where you
just don't have time to mess with installation). It includes pyreadline for
full tab completion and color support. Get the first release (fully functional,
based on svn IPython) `here
<http://vivainio.googlepages.com/ipykit.zip>`__. Just unzip and run ipython.exe
to go.

Backports for 0.8.1 (may 23, 2007)
----------------------------------

We will backport some critical bug fixes to 0.8.1, if necessary - even if we
may not cut an official release, you can trust that the quality of the latest
version in 0.8.1 branch is at least as good as the 0.8.1 release. Get it with
svn by doing `svn co
